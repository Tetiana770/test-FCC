          <h3>Birth (1950-1956)</h3>
          <p class="description">
            In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction introduced
            the world to the concept of robots with artificial intelligence.The
            history of artificial intelligence dates back to the 1950s, and by
            then the concept of artificial intelligence had been assimilated by
            enthusiasts of that period.
          </p>

          <p class="description">
            One such person was Alan Turing, a young British scholar who
            explored the mathematical possibilities of artificial intelligence.
            Turing suggested that humans use reason to solve problems and make
            decisions, so why shouldn't machines do the same? This idea formed
            the basis of his 1950 paper Computing and Intelligence , in which he
            described how to create intelligent machines and how to test their
            intelligence.

                1955 - Allen Newell and Herbert Simon created the first
                artificial intelligence program - Logic Theorist. She proved 38
                out of 52 mathematical theorems and also found new proofs for
                some others.

                1956 - the term "artificial intelligence" was first used by the
                American computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth
                conference.

                1966 - Joseph Weitzenbaum developed the first chatbot - ELIZA.
                It was named after Eliza Doolittle, the heroine of Bernard
                Shaw's play "Pygmalion", who was taught the language of the
                "higher class of people". ELIZA simulated a dialogue with a

            in the field of artificial intelligence due to high costs and
            inefficient results.

          Today, artificial intelligence is one of the most popular terms in the
          world. According to some forecasts, AI will bring $15.7 trillion to
          the global economy by 2035. He already creates a lot of digital
          content - texts, pictures, music, videos, etc. The basics of its
          functioning should be known at least in order not to lose business or
          work.
